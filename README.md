# Inventory-Management
The main goal of this project is to develop a web-based Inventory Management System that helps users (like warehouse managers or store owners) to store, organize, and analyze inventory data efficiently. The system also uses Machine Learning to predict the future demand or usage of materials, helping in better stock management and decision-making.
